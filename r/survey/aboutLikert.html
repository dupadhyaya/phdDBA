Diverging and 100% stacked bar charts are an effective way to visualize Likert Scale data. In R
there are two main packages -- HH and likert -- that turn Likert Scale data into pretty charts. I have
used both extensively to make pretty plots and, personally, I like the likert package more because
it works with ggplot objects and functions but I will run through a quick tutorial of both here
